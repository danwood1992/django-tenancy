# Contributing to Django django_realms Boilerplate

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Django django_realms, this is my first open source project and i wasnt expecting anyone to be honest. It's people like you that make open source such a great thing.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork and create a branch with a description of what you are fixing and how.

A good branch name would be (where issue #123 is the ticket you're working on):

```git checkout -b 123-contribution```
## Implement your fix or feature
At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first, is till am to be honest.

### Make a pull request
Make sure to push your changes to your fork and then submit a pull request. Include the issue number you're addressing (if applicable) and a summary of the changes you've made

## Thanks!
