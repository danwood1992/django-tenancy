## Welcome to Django Realms

Welcome to Django Realms, an amalgamation of the robustness of Django and the dynamism of React, tailored to provide a seamless development experience. At its core, Django Realms embodies a vision of an opinionated tech stack, built upon technologies and practices that resonate with our philosophy of effective and efficient web development.

## Open source

As an open-source project, not only do we invite you to utilize Django Realms for your applications, but we also encourage you to dive deep, tinker, and even contribute to its growth. The philosophy behind making it open source stems from the belief that the combined knowledge and expertise of the community can enhance, refine, and propel Django Realms to new heights.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites
While Django Realms is crafted to be intuitive, having a foundational understanding of Django, React, and frontend development will undoubtedly smoothen your journey. However, if you're new to any of these, don't be disheartened! The beauty of Django Realms lies in its adaptability and its capacity to be a learning platform.

## Built on top of the following technologies:

**Django**: The high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. If you're unfamiliar, start with [Django's official documentation.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/)

**NextJS**: A powerful framework for building React applications, bolstered by both server and client-side rendering capabilities. Go over to [NextJs ](https://nextjs.org/docs). They have great documentation.

**GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. [GraphQL's official docs](https://graphql.org/learn/) are a great place to start.

**PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system. [PostgreSQL's official docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) are a great place to start.



**Frontend Development**: The realm of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To brush up or learn from scratch, MDN Web Docs is an excellent resource.

Remember, every expert was once a beginner. Each of these platforms has extensive documentation and a strong community backing, ensuring you're never alone in your learning journey.

Why "**Opinionated**"?
"Django Realms" is unapologetically opinionated. But why?

Being "opinionated" in software means making decisions based on a set of best practices that the creator believes in. Instead of providing every conceivable configuration or option, we've streamlined Django Realms to incorporate what we believe is the "best" way to handle specific tasks or challenges. The underlying motive? To save time, reduce decision fatigue, and let developers focus on crafting functionalities.

However, the beauty of open-source is that while we provide a structured path, you are always free to modify, extend, or even challenge these opinions to better suit your unique requirements or beliefs.

**Dive Right In!**
With the ethos clear and resources at your fingertips, you are poised to embark on a rewarding journey with Django Realms. As you progress, remember to share feedback, contribute, and most importantly, enjoy the process of creating!
