## Welcome to Django Realms

Welcome to Django Realms, an amalgamation of the robustness of Django and the dynamism of React, tailored to provide a seamless development experience. At its core, Django Realms embodies a vision of an opinionated tech stack, built upon technologies and practices that resonate with our philosophy of effective and efficient web development.

As an open-source project, not only do we invite you to utilize Django Realms for your applications, but we also encourage you to dive deep, tinker, and even contribute to its growth. The philosophy behind making it open source stems from the belief that the combined knowledge and expertise of the community can enhance, refine, and propel Django Realms to new heights.
